He prefers FPS, MMORPGs and survival games to other categories, and so played a lot of Halo 1 & 2 and Age of Empires 2 in middle and high school. His family lived in Ontario from 1997 - 2005, before returning to Prince Edward Island.

He was fortunate, as his parents were really supportive from the beginning.\nHis YouTube and Twitch channels only started growing in 2015/2016. He was inspired to do so when he found World of Warcraft videos on YouTube. He immediately downloaded Fraps and began creating videos on Window’s Movie Maker beta. He uploaded any WoW content that he conceived of. However, at the time, people couldn’t monetize their content, so it was entirely as a hobby. He only did so because he enjoyed it and because he wanted to help others to grind, progress and level up in World of Warcraft. Over the years, he slowly gained views and followers on YouTube. Until 2012, he only had enough time to upload one or two videos a month.\nIn 2010, he became involved with TGN’s Wow channel. He and a few other gamers created joint content on a the TGN YouTube channel.

A few months later, justin.tv closed and they were all transferred to Twitch. He became a Twitch partner early on but was only able to monetize his channel from advertising revenue.\nBut his main job became working for TGN and promoting and assisting other content creators, so his own channels wound up taking a back seat. He continued to create content, but very irregularly.\nIn June 2014, he decided to stream DayZ Standalone for three hours every morning before going to his real-world job. By then, there was a sub button, and there was therefore potential for him to monetize his content. However, he was only able to acquire his sub-button in September.\nIn June 2015, he left his job because they were relocating.

He loved it and saved up his birthday money so that he could buy himself one. His brother decided to buy one for himself as well, and the two of them spent a great deal of time playing Pokémon together. However, the game was only available in English, so the two of them were forced to start learning English in order to understand it.\nTheir father bought them a Nintendo 64 a couple of years later along with Mario, Mario Kart and Donkey Kong games, which they would spend hours playing along with their cousins while they were growing up. Outside of gaming, he also played some sports, as he enjoyed being active and playing video games with his friends.\nWhen he was around ten years old, he also got into Pokémon trading cards. However, he was only able to build up his collection by selling cards on behalf of other kids and earning commission off of the cards. His mom eventually began entering tournaments and playing against teenagers. But he had to stop playing when the new rotation was released.\nHis parents divorced when he was in his early teens and he chose to live with his dad. He then got into Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG when he was a round thirteen and started playing it in a TCG club. ShadyBunny began entering local tournaments and developed his skills until he was able to consistently beat his opponents and spent a lot of time training with his neighbor for major tournament. By fourteen, he was the top ranked player in Belgium. He later stopped playing when the meta changed to be more balanced for weaker players.\nWhen he entered high school, he was severely bullied and avoided going to school. This caused his grades to drop drastically. He decided to deliberately fail his exams in order to be held back so that he wouldn’t have to continue on with his current classmates. Around that time, he became involved with World of Warcraft as a restauration druid horde member in a top raiding guild. His guild members respected him, and he made many online friends, which helped him to get through his remaining high school years.\nHe later decided to cut down on raiding to rather focus on arena, in order to have the time to incorporate IRL bodybuilding into his schedule. But he failed another year of school due to these distractions as well as recovering from a severely broken ankle. He therefore decided to transfer to a sports-focused high school to complete his education there. His social life really took off there, as he had far more in common with them. This was especially true, as he was put into a class with others who had also failed that grade before. This was also when he discovered League of Legends.\nWhen StarCraft II was released, he transitioned to that and made it to low masters, but soon became burned out, as he was out of school and was spending almost all of his time playing it. He then quit gaming to study Fitness Training. After he completed his year-long course in 2013, he got back into League of Legends. He dedicated a lot of time into honing his skills until he reached Diamond 3.', 'PROFESSIONAL GAMING\nWhen he gained a high enough skill level with his LoL Assassin gameplay, he decided to start streaming his gameplay in order to educate others.

People have to care and want to watch your stream. Being exceptional is your biggest tool to growing IMO. All else is complimentary, especially if you lack that foundation. If you\'re a fun-loving, positive-mentality, accessible streamer who loves Pokémon, video games, nerd culture and ""having a rad time"" -- you\'re as generic as wall paint. And there\'s like ... (literally) 3.2 million active broadcasters on Twitch monthly who are just like you. No amount of consistent schedule, bots, follower alerts, or other things will help if the content is subpar in the first place. And to be transparent, this advice is mostly a jab at some who have entitlement to growth purely on basis they stream 60-80hr a week. If you\'re grinding that hard and not growing, it\'s important to reflect upon the content you\'re producing and the environment you\'re in and how discoverability works there (Twitch vs YouTube Gaming, for example have huge differences for this).', 'SOURCES\nAMA with Trihex - Monday.
